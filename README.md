# gofiber-basic-api
This little project was made to start studying GoLang

## The idea
Actually this repository is my first touch with Go Fiber and his structure with http requests.

### What is this?
A simple Todo system that you can full manipulate the task list and hist properties.

### Installation
- 1. Execute ```go instal``` to install all dependencies
- 2. Execute ```go run main.go``` or ```air``` (if you use Go Air) to execute the app
